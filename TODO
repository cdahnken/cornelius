1. Performance improvements
The matrices are currently multiplied with the Lanczos vectors in a 
kronecker-like fashion, saving a lot of unnecessary work. For a 4x4 systems
each of the up and down hopping matrices is still of a side length of ~12k,
which is clearly the bottle neck. Each matrix is sparse (couple of %) filling,
so there is great potential.

2. Ground state vector calculation
Currently only the ground state energy is computed. 

3. Random number generation is flawed for larger than 48
